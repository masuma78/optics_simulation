	<h1>Optics Bench</h1>

	<p>Shown is an optics bench that allows you to add various optical elements (lens, mirror, and aperture) and light
			sources (beam, object, point source) and see their effect. Elements and sources can be added to the optics bench by
			clicking on the appropriate
			button and then clicking inside the simulation at the desired location. Moving the mouse around in the simulation gives you
			the position of the mouse, while a click-drag will allow you to measure angle <strong>(position is given in
			  centimeters and angle is given in degrees)</strong>.</p>
		
		  <p>Add a mirror to the optics bench by clicking on the mirror button and then clicking inside the animation to place
			the mirror. Adjust the focal point of the mirror by dragging on the round hotspots. Notice that you can make the
			mirror either concave
			or convex. Make the mirror concave with a focal length of 0.5 cm and place it near the right-hand side of the
			simulation. Now add a source of light by clicking on the object button and then clicking inside the animation. You can
			later add other sources
			of light.</p>
		
		  <p>Notice the rays emanating from the object, their reflection from the mirror, and the resulting image. Click the
			head of the arrow (the object) and move it around. First note that there are three rays that emanate from the head
			of the arrow. One ray
			comes off parallel to the principal axis (the yellow centerline) and is reflected through the focal point, one ray
			comes off at an angle to hit the mirror on the principal axis and is reflected, and one ray passes through the
			principal axis at the
			focal point of the mirror and is reflected parallel to the principal axis. </p>
		
		  <p>Do the rays always behave as you expect them to? Probably not. As you drag the head of the source and change its
			height and position, what do you notice about the rays when they reflect from the mirror? The rays reflect from the
			vertical line tangent
			to the mirror's surface. If you click on the mirror, you will see this line in green. This simulation uses what is
			called the small-angle approximation. This approximation assumes that the object is of a much smaller dimension than
			the mirror. For larger
			focal length mirrors, you may barely notice the approximation, but for smaller focal length mirrors it becomes
			increasingly noticeable. In this Illustration a focal length of f &lt; 1 cm will yield a noticeable difference
			between the rays you expect
			and the result of the small-angle approximation. Click on the mirror and drag the round hotspots to change the
			mirror's focal length to see the effect.</p>
		
		  <p>The optics bench allows you to try many different configurations to see how light will interact with a mirror. Take
			some time to play with the simulation. You may also find it helpful to refer back to this Illustration as you develop
			your understanding
			of optics. A brief description of the three sources is given below.</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>
		
			  <p>The &quot;Beam&quot; button adds a beam of parallel light rays. The angle of the light rays can be changed by
				dragging the hotspot after clicking on the beam.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
		
			  <p>The &quot;Object&quot; button adds an arrow as an object. A ray diagram is drawn for the object if an optical
				element is present.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
		
			  <p>The &quot;Source&quot; button adds a point source of light. The spread of the light rays can be adjusted by
				dragging the hotspot after clicking on the source.</p>
			</li>
		  </ul>
